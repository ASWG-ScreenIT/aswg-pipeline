This retrospective hospital-based study described the complete epidemiological surveillance data of the Jakarta Health Office, including 4265 adults and children with confirmed COVID-19 admitted in 55 COVID-19-designated referral hospitals, during the first five months of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This analysis represents the largest patient series hospitalised with COVID-19 in Southeast Asia, and one of the largest from LMIC to date. The observed disease pattern broadly reflects that reported globally, with patients usually presenting with multiple symptoms of fever, cough, malaise and/or shortness of breath, and nearly 40% having a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia at admission. Overall mortality was 12% (497/4265), and deaths occurred across all ages. Although the majority (57%) of all admissions were younger than 50 years, including 5% children, the large majority (78%) of people who died were 50 years or older. Mortality increased with age, from 7% in patients aged 40-49 years to 34% in patients aged ≥70 years. Mortality among children below 5 years was unexpectedly high at 11% (7/61), which has not been reported elsewhere, although available information on any underlying conditions and the exact cause of death of those children was incomplete. Elevated risk of in-hospital death was independently associated with higher age, history of hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease, or liver disease, pneumonia, multiple (>3) symptoms at presentation, and shorter (≤7) duration between symptom onset and hospital admission. The increased risk of in-hospital death associated with advancing age was further augmented by the presence of one or more chronic comorbidities, which were recorded to be present in 31% of patients. The overall COVID-19-related mortality in Jakarta (12%) was substantially lower than those reported in high-income countries, for example, in the US (21%) [7] and the UK (26%) [9], but those populations were substantially older, with more comorbidities and more frequent presentation with severe disease. By contrast, a nationwide analysis of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in China reported an overall mortality of just 3·1%, but in that population, severe cases and comorbidities were relatively infrequent, while the median age was similar to Jakarta [4]. Compared with other settings, we found age-specific mortality rates in Jakarta to be similar for patients <50 years (5% in Jakarta, 5% in the US [7], and 4% in the UK [9]), but slightly lower for patients ≥50 years (21% in Jakarta, 27% in the US [7], and 29% in the UK [9]. Given that older age has been consistently associated with severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19 [2,5–7,9], the lower median age (46 years) in Jakarta compared to studies from North America and Europe probably accounts for most of the differences observed in overall in-hospital mortality. The younger age at admission is likely to be mainly related to a younger age distribution in the general population in Jakarta, compared to Europe, the US, and China. Nonetheless, we do not dismiss distinct behavioural factors related to risk of infection, for example adherence to preventive measures, mobility, and health seeking, as also reported in India [16]. National surveillance data in Indonesia to date reported a case fatality rate in children aged 0-5 years of 1.0% (123/11 916) [18]. This is much higher than a case fatality rate of 0·16% in children below 5 years of age in a recent large epidemiological study in Southern India [16]. Several other studies in China [26], Brazil [13,27], Uganda [14], and South Africa [15] have reported COVID-19-related deaths among children under 5 years to be rare. A review of data from US, Korea and Europe early in the epidemic estimated the overall case fatality rate among children (0-19 years old) to be low at 0·03 per 100 000 (44/42 846) [28]. Although children appear generally less severely affected than older individuals [29], COVID-19 in children can also be characterized by rapid progressive deterioration leading to death, especially in children with comorbidities. Notably, increasing reports from both high-income and LMIC have described a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, which can lead to serious illness [30]; to date, to our knowledge, no such cases have been reported in Indonesia. Factors that explain the high mortality observed among children in Jakarta hospitals may be various, including treatment delays, limited paediatric intensive care capacity, presence of underlying conditions, such as malignancy or malnutrition, among other factors. Further investigations are planned to confirm the extent and cause of death among young children with COVID-19 in Jakarta. Evidence from previous studies suggests that underlying comorbidities, including pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, were associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes [4,7–9]. Chronic comorbidities among COVID-19 patients were less frequent in Jakarta (31% of patients) than reported in large patient series in North America [7,8], South America [13], and Europe [9]. This could reflect the relatively young population admitted to Jakarta hospitals, but also under-reporting of comorbidities by patients, or under-diagnosis due to variable access to quality health services. Presence of one or more comorbidities, especially pre-existing hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease or liver disease strongly increased the risk of death in Jakarta, by 40%, 60%, 70% and 300%, respectively, compared to those without such comorbidities. These findings were consistent with similar studies elsewhere [4,8,9]. In contrast, similar to a study in the US [8], we found no association between diabetes and mortality in Jakarta, whereas studies in China [4] and the UK [9] did so. Obesity has also been recognised as an important risk factor of mortality [9,17], but we could not assess that for lack of complete data. In Jakarta, the median time from symptom onset to death (median 11 days) was shorter than reported in hospital-based studies from Japan (17 days) [22], China (18·5 days) [2], and the US (12·7 days) [6]; the relatively short in-hospital trajectory towards clinical deterioration and death (median 6 days) could suggest possible delays in hospital admission and treatment. Among survivors, the length of hospital stay was much longer (median 26 days) than reported in other studies [2,6,7,9,22], which is most likely due to the requirement of two consecutive PCR-negative test results prior to discharge, with results delayed due to limited PCR testing capacity in Jakarta during the early phase of the epidemic. This study had some limitations. The retrospective design and reliance on routine hospital surveillance data meant that, for some key baseline variables, data were incomplete or uniformly unavailable (e.g. vital signs, TB and HIV co-infection, radiology examination, routine laboratory results). Comorbidities were often self-reported or could be under-diagnosed, potentially resulting in underreporting and hence underestimation of effect sizes. Details on supportive care and treatment received, particularly respiratory support and management of secondary infections, were also not available for this analysis. Findings from hospitals reported here may not reflect the mortality rate and risk factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality in the general population. In conclusion, risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality in Jakarta, Indonesia are broadly similar to those in more developed settings in North America, Europe, and Asia, dominated by advanced age and comorbidities. Lower overall mortality in Jakarta was likely driven by the lower median age of the hospital population. While children represented just 5% of admissions, the 11% mortality that occurred among children below 5 years should prompt further investigation of them as potentially highly vulnerable in LMIC settings. The findings highlight the need for enhanced context-specific public health action to reduce infection risk among vulnerable populations and improved care and treatment for the diseased.
