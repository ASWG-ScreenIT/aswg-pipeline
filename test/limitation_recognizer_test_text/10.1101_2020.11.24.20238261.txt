The importance of understanding the COVID-19 disease in young adults cannot be overstated, as the weekly number of such cases reported to the CDC is increasing over time and especially as students have returned to campus settings.13 This preliminary study contradicts the perception that this “yet to be defined” post-COVID syndrome predominantly affects middle-aged adults, as just over half of our young adult sample reported at least two COVID-19 symptoms and/or related complications 30 days post illness onset, at minimum; a majority were still symptomatic more than 50 days later. Our comparison of post-COVID syndrome participants to those never diagnosed with COVID-19 suggests that the protracted symptoms experienced by the post-COVID syndrome group are not merely due to stress associated with the current pandemic or college attendance. Of paramount concern is that a third of the post-COVID syndrome group had not had contact with a healthcare provider, despite serious symptoms, including dyspnea, exercise intolerance, chest pain, and chemosensory impairment. The current message in the United States that COVID-19 is benign and/or a short lived illness in young adults is inconsistent with reports that adolescents and young adults may require hospitalization,5,6 and several recent fatalities in healthy university students.8 Understandably, scientific efforts since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 have predominantly focused on prevention (e.g., vaccine development, studying the efficacy of social distancing and masks, developing early detection tests) and development of treatment approaches to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, with little attention within the scientific and medical community to the lingering effects of the disease. As a result, individuals with protracted COVID symptoms, frequently referred to as “long-haulers” or “long COVID” in the media, formed social-media based support groups which have spearheaded advocacy efforts. Surveys conducted by such advocacy groups suggest that a heterogeneous, multisystemic constellation of symptoms and complications are experienced by these individuals,14,15 which has prompted more recent attention to post-COVID syndrome in the medical literature16-19 and is consistent with our present findings. The only longitudinal study of putatively recovered COVID-19 cases found that 98% of 201 participants were still experiencing symptoms four months post illness onset, including fatigue, myalgias, headaches, cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.20 Consistent with these symptoms, multi-organ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected impairment in one or more organs, including heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and spleen in 70% of the sample. Few of these participants had any pre-existing health conditions and only 18% were hospitalized during acute illness. While it remains unknown whether some or all of those with post-COVID syndrome will eventually return to their pre-COVID level of health and functioning, post-COVID morbidity is likely to place a substantial burden on healthcare systems that are already depleted by their response to acute COVID-19. Notably, all but one of the post-COVID syndrome participants in this study were female. While mortality from COVID-19 is sexually dimorphic, with males accounting for approximately 70% of deaths,21 the present findings suggest that females are more prone to a prolonged course of illness and/or post-COVID-19 complications, similar to the preprint findings from the Mayo Clinic.20 Innate and immune responses are stronger in females than in males.22 It is plausible that the more active female immune system may be an advantage in clearing the virus, but this could be a double-edged sword if the female immune activation produces a lingering syndrome. This sexually dimorphic immune response is further supported by a recent study which found that 12.5% of males but only 2.6% of females with severe COVID-19 had neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies against interferons which could explain some of the increased male mortality.23
